# Bank Loan Data Analysis
Overview

Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial decisions.
This project dives deep into analyzing bank loan data to uncover important information that can help stakeholders make better decisions. We have fetched out important aspects from ther data such as total loan applications, disbursed amounts, and the total received, inclusive of interest payments
Furthermore, the analysis differentiates between "good" loans, which have been successfully repaid, and "bad" loans, where payments are outstanding even beyond the loan term. This distinction enables a nuanced understanding of loan performance and risk assessment.
We have analyzed diverse dimensions such as the purpose of the loan, loan terms, home ownership status, employment details, regional trends, and debt-to-income ratios. By dissecting these facets, the project illuminates patterns, trends, and correlations within the loan portfolio, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning for lenders.
